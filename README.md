# DumpItForLinux

# Getting Started
`dumpit-linux` (or `DumpItForLinux`) is very straight forward - the only thing you need is root permission as it relies on /proc/kcore to create a compact version, and is compatible with the old and new versions of `/proc/kcore`.

Following the same philosophy as DumpIt for Windows which relies on the Microsoft Crash Dump format and is fully compatible with WinDbg, DumpItForLinux relies on the Linux ELF Core format and is fully compatible with `gdb`,  `crash`, and `drgn`.

In short, why you should use this utility:
- Interoperability. The generated output file is compatible with popular Linux debugging and troubleshooting tools and frameworks: `gdb`, `crash`, and `drgn`.
- Open file formats. The output file does not rely on a new file format, it creates a Linux ELF CORE file which is the reason it is interoperable with the above tools. And, the utility leverages an existing compression archive format (`.tar.zst`) which relies on the super-fast [zstandard compression algorithm](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/).
- Rust. This utility has been written in Rust, meaning that it is not only memory-safe - it can later be expanded to support additional remote streaming options.
- User-land. This utility relies on `/proc/kcore` meaning that no Linux kernel module is required. Root permission is, however, needed.

## Building
### Google Container Optimized OS
```
toolkit
apt-get update
apt-get install pkg-config liblzma-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
mkdir ../dumps
cargo run --release -- -r ../dumps/dump.$container_host_build_id.core
echo Get symbols too
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/cos-tools/$container_host_build_id/vmlinux > ../dumps/vmlinux-$container_host_build_id
```
Files can be remotely recovered with `gcloud compute scp`
### Linux
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Run the following command
```
cargo build --release
```
`cargo build --release` puts the resulting binary in `target/release` instead of `target/debug`.

Compiling in debug mode is the default for development-- compilation time is shorter since the compiler doesn't do optimizations, but the code will run slower. Release mode takes longer to compile, but the code will run faster.

## What are Kernel crash dumps?
More information can be found on the [Ubuntu Documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/kernel-crash-dump).

## Usage
### CLI Usage
```
DumpIt (For Linux - x64 & ARM64) 0.1.0 (2023-01-27T13:42:56Z)
Linux memory acquisition that makes sense.
Copyright (c) 2022, Magnet Forensics, Inc.

A program that makes memory analysis for incident response easy, scalable and practical

Usage: dumpitforlinux [OPTIONS] [Output Path]

Arguments:
  [Output Path]  Path to the output archive, file, or named pipe

Options:
  -0, --to-stdout  Write to stdout instead of a file
  -r, --raw        Create a single core dump file instead of a compressed archive
  -v, --verbose    Print extra output while parsing
  -p, --pipe       Writes output to a named pipe. Note that if DumpIt is set to write an archive, it will write the archive to the pipe
  -h, --help       Print help information
  -V, --version    Print version information
```
### Generate a tar.zst with the default generated name
```
sudo dumpitforlinux 
```
![default](./screenshots/dumpit-sample.gif)
### Decompression
```
tar -I zstd -xvf <filename>.tar.zst
```

## Troubleshooting
### Installing debugging symbols
#### Ubuntu
[Learn more about Ubuntu Debug Symbol Packages](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Debug%20Symbol%20Packages)

```
echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com $(lsb_release -cs) main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com $(lsb_release -cs)-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com $(lsb_release -cs)-proposed main restricted universe multiverse" | \
sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install linux-image-`uname -r`-dbgsym
```
### Testing with crash
`crash` is a very useful utility for troubleshooting and testing kernel crash dumps.

[Learn more about crash](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/crash.8.html)

```
sudo apt install crash
sudo apt-get install linux-image-`uname -r`-dbgsym
crash <path to dump> /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-`uname -r`
```

### Testing with drgn
You can load a memory image generated by `dumpit-linux` into `drgn` too. 

Refer to the official page, to find out [how to install drgn](https://github.com/osandov/drgn#installation).

```
sudo pip3 install drgn
drgn -c <path to dump>
```
